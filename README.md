# [ofCourse][Spring 2015] Animation by Code

## Description

*This workshop is a very condensed version of the first weeks of the homonymous class taught at Parsons MFA D+T.*

Animation is all about things that move... or better yet, a sequence of stills that represent movement when flipped through in high speed. Some of the great challenges in animation lie in defining where the subject will be in the next frame as the artist tries to represent a particular vision of movement: natural, dramatic, exaggerated. Code can help us in this task.

## What is ofCourse?

[ofCourse](http://www.ofcourse.io/) is a creative coding program aimed at people with little to no coding skills. It provides a hands-on experience, tools, ideas, and full support for students to make their own projects.

 
## What should students bring?

* A functioning and fully charged laptop with [your IDE of choice](http://openframeworks.cc/download/) installed.
* openFrameworks (please download and install from the [website](http://openframeworks.cc/download/)). Follow the instructions to your OS and chosen IDE.
* If you're wondering which IDE to choose from, for this class I recommend to have XCode on Mac or Codeblocks on Windows.


## Course Overview

Code brings a whole new toolset to an already rich collection of animation techniques, such as drawings, puppets, etching, pixilation and others. To understand animation made through computer programming, we'll go through basic geometry and physics principles that govern the motion of objects – trigonometry, gravity, attraction and repulsion and others. We'll understand how these principles act in real world objects and how they can be simulated through code. Natural movement will be our goal in this class.
